[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds a couple of simple features to Community-Online-Tools.

I've used VPPAdminTools for years to run my server and develop my mods - but I got tired of the crashlog nullpointer errors never being fixed and item quantity spawner not working properly and just the general lack of regular updates etc to keep it working with the latest versions of DayZ.

So I've migrated to COT... but COT lacks some features I really liked in VPPAdminTools.

So I made a simple addon mod for COT which adds 2 new features I use a lot when managing and developing my server and mods:

1) You can now view the in-game map location of all items on the COT map
2) You can now copy object and player locations directly to clipboard with a hotkey

To see all the spawn locations/current locations of in-game items, just open the object spawner in COT and click the MAP button in the search bar. It will show the in-game locations of the selected item/object/building/etc. The number next to the item name is its lifetime (how long til it despawns).

To copy the current location and orientation of the object you're aiming at, press the "P" key by default (or rebind it in COT's keybinds under "ZenCOT - Copy Position")

Some bonus features:

- To delete an object further than 3 meters away hold down left-control key.
- To copy the vector coordinates to clipboard without the "," between each X,Y,Z hold left Alt key.
- To copy the vector coordinates of your player's location and ignore object at cursor, hold left-control key.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

It will obviously also require Community-Online-Tools to function.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
